If you've ever tried to access google chrome while the internet is down, you've probably seen a screen simlar
to this:

T-Rex Run is a simple game.  The user plays as the dinosaur, using the space bar to jump over incoming cacti
and birds.  It's an easy game to play, and python makes it even easier.

## Automate the Game
In order to automate the game, there are two user inputs that we have to consider:
 1. Clicking the center to start/restart the game
 2. Pressing and unpressing the space bar to jump

To accomplish these tasks, three python modules were used:
 1. [NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/) - for summating pixel values
 2. [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - for image processing
 3. [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - for controlling mouse and keyboard input
